ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
===============
 
Following files are originally from Impara 0.2, modified to suite our need:
./Makefile
./config.inc
./check_wp/Makefile
./check_wp/parseoptions.h  (corresponding Impara 0.2 file is impara_parseoptions.h
./check_wp/parseoptions.cpp (corresponding Impara 0.2 file is impara_parseoptions.cpp)

We are using CBMC's(http://www.cprover.org/svn/cbmc/releases/cbmc-4.5/) APIs for parsing of source code.

We are using Z3(https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) as backend decision procedure.
